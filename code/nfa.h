/**
 * A representation of an NFA (non-deterministic finite automata) state machine.
 * If unfamiliar, please search online for an image of the usual circles and
 * arrows picture of an NFA.
 *
 * What is the NFA Model?
 * ----------------------
 *
 *  - NFAs have a list of states (circles), and arcs (arrows) between the states.
 *
 *  - The idea is, we start at one state and follow arcs to other states
 *    conditionally based on the label on the arc.
 *
 *  - Normally, in following an arc, a character of the input is consumed.
 *
 *  - If, when all characters of the input string have been consumed we have
 *    ended in a state marked accept, then the string matches
 *    (or in other words: the string is in the language described by the NFA).
 *
 *  - Arcs can only be traveled over if the current character in the input
 *    string meets the requirements of the label on the arc.
 *
 *  - The NFA can be in multiple states at once (if it was deterministic
 *    instead, it would only be able to be in one state at a time). As such
 *    sometimes we refer to states the NFA is in as active states.
 *
 * This structure
 * --------------
 *
 *  - In this representation, we store multiple arcs with the same label
 *    together. We store one label with a list of arcs.
 *    - This is done because we have many arcs with the same labels and this
 *      structure mirrors the structure of thefinal assembly code generated.
 *
 *  - For representing states, we simply use an integer index number.
 *    - Since states need no extra information, we don't need to store an array
 *      of them. We only need to remember how many there are.
